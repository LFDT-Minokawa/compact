## Abstract

A Compact Improvement Proposal (CoIP) is a formalised design document for the Compact community and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed.
A CoIP provides information or describes a change to the Compact ecosystem, processes, or environment concisely and in sufficient technical detail.
In this CoIP, we explain what a CoIP is, how the CoIP process functions, the role of the CoIP Editors, and how users should go about proposing, discussing, and structuring a CoIP.

The Minokawa project intends CoIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and documenting design decisions that have gone into Compact.
Plus, because CoIPs are text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of significant changes affecting Compact.


## Motivation

CoIPs aim to address two challenges mainly:

The need for various parties to agree on a common approach to ease the interoperability of tools or interfaces.
The need to propose and discuss changes to the protocol or established practice of the ecosystem.
The CoIP process does not by itself offer any form of governance.
For example, it does not govern the process by which proposed changes to the Cardano protocol are implemented and deployed.
Yet, it is a crucial, community-driven component of the governance decision pipeline as it helps to collect thoughts and proposals in an organised fashion.
Additionally, specific projects may choose to actively engage with the CoIP process for some or all changes to their project.

The process detailed herein is intentionally light weight and is expected to expand evolve as the Compact community grows.
This document outlines the technical structure of the CoIP and the technical requirements of the submission and review process. 

## Specification

### Versioning

The specification in this CoIP will be versioned using semantic versioning (SemVer).
Any changes to the specification must be submitted as a new CoIP if they affect backwards compatibility or introduce new requirements.


### **Process Overview**

The Compact Improvement Proposal (CoIP) process consists of the following stages:



1. **Idea Formulation:** An idea for an improvement is conceived.
2. **CoIP Drafting:** A formal CoIP document is created.
3. **Submission:** The CoIP is submitted as a Pull Request (PR) to the Compact GitHub repository.
4. **Review and Discussion:** The community and CoIP Editors review and discuss the CoIP.
5. **Status Progression:** The CoIP progresses through various statuses based on review and consensus.
6. **Implementation:** Accepted CoIPs are implemented by development teams.
7. **Deployment:** Implemented changes are deployed in a Compact network upgrade.


### **CoIP Categories**

CoIPs are categorized to help organize and manage the different types of proposals:



* **Core:** Changes to the core Compact protocol, consensus mechanisms, virtual machine, or other fundamental aspects.
  These may require a network upgrade.
* **Standards:** Proposals for standards and conventions related to application development, smart contract interfaces, data formats, etc., within the Compact ecosystem.
* **Networking:** Improvements to network communication, peer discovery, and other networking-related aspects.
* **Governance:** Proposals related to the governance of the Compact blockchain, including decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities.
* **Informational:** Provides general information, guidelines, or research related to the Compact programming language but does not propose a specific change.


### **CoIP Statuses**

CoIPs can have the following statuses:



* **Proposed:** The CoIP has been formally submitted as a PR to the CoIPs repository.
* **Review:** The CoIP is undergoing community and editor review.
* **Accepted:** The CoIP is accepted as meeting the CoIP standards by editors.
* **Active:** The CoIP has been accepted and meets its "Path to Active" criteria.
* **Superseded:** A newer CoIP replaces this CoIP.
* **Obsolete:** The CoIP is no longer considered relevant.
* **Rejected:** The CoIP was not accepted.
* **Withdrawn:** The author(s) have withdrawn the CoIP.


#### **Submission**



* A Finalized CoIP should be submitted as a Pull Request (PR) to the[Compact](https://github.com/LFDT-Minokawa/compact) (this) repository of the Minokawa project GitHub organization as a pull request named after the proposal's title.
  The pull request title should not include a CoIP number (and use ? instead as number); the editors will assign one.
  Discussions may precede a proposal.
  Early reviews and discussions streamline the process down the line.
* Upon review, the PR title should be: CoIP-XXXX: [CoIP Title] (where XXXX is the next available CoIP number, assigned by a CoIP Editor). 

Note: Pull requests should not include implementation code: any code bases should instead be provided as links to a code repository.

Note: Proposals addressing a specific MPS should also be listed in the corresponding MPS header, in 'Proposed Solutions', to keep track of ongoing work.


#### **Review and Discussion**



* Once a CoIP is submitted, it enters a period of public review and discussion.
* Feedback is encouraged from all Compact community members, including:
    * Developers
    * Node operators
    * Application developers
    * Token holders
    * Users
* Discussion should take place on the GitHub PR page.
* Workshop sessions to discuss and review proposals, coordinated by XXXXXX
* CoIP Editors will:
    * Ensure the CoIP follows the template and meets the minimum quality standards.
    * Facilitate discussion and ensure all concerns are addressed.
    * Assign a CoIP number.
    * Track the CoIP's progress.
* Technical experts may be consulted for specific aspects of the proposal.


#### **Implementation**



* Once a CoIP is Accepted, it becomes a candidate for implementation.
* Engineering teams (Shielded Architects & Engineers, Community developers) will implement the changes specified in the CoIP.
* Implementation may involve:
    * Changes to Compact Architecture
    * Modifying the Compact protocol
    * Updating client software
    * Developing new tools or libraries


### **Artifacts and Tools**



* **CoIP Document:** The core artifact is the CoIP document itself, written in Markdown and stored in the CoIPs repository.
* **CoIP Template:** A standardized Markdown template for creating CoIPs (see below).
* **GitHub Repository:** The `coips` subdirectory (in the Compact repository) on GitHub will be used to:
    * Store all CoIP documents.
    * Track the status of each CoIP.
    * Facilitate discussion through PRs.
* **Discussion Forums:** The Compact Governance Hub (future state) and Discord server should be used for broader discussions and early-stage idea sharing. 
* **Meeting Notes:** Notes from any meetings related to CoIP discussions should be publicly available in this GitHub repository or linked from it.


### **CoIP Editors**

The CoIP process relies on a group of *CoIP Editors* to manage the process, ensure quality, and facilitate community discussion.


#### **Role and Responsibilities**

CoIP Editors are responsible for:



* Ensuring that CoIPs adhere to the CoIP template and meet the minimum quality standards (e.g., clarity, completeness, technical soundness).
* Assigning CoIP numbers.
* Tracking the progress of CoIPs.
* Facilitating community discussion and helping to resolve technical disagreements.
* Determining when a CoIP has reached sufficient consensus to move to the Accepted status.
* Maintaining the CoIPs repository.

### **Selection and Qualifications**


CoIP Editors should be selected based on the following criteria:



* **Technical Expertise:** A strong understanding of blockchain technology and the Compact programming language architecture.
* **Community Standing:** Respected and trusted members of the Compact community.
* **Impartiality:** Ability to evaluate CoIPs objectively and fairly.
* **Communication Skills:** Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
* **Availability:** Willingness to dedicate sufficient time to review and process CoIPs.

### Nomination and Rotation of Editors

The initial set of CoIP Editors will be appointed by the Compact Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
Subsequently the below set of rules will apply to the addition and removal of CoIP Editors. 

To become a CoIP Editor one must be:
- Nominated by anyone.
- All sitting CoIP Editors must agree to their becoming a CoIP Editor by public vote at a CoIP Editors' meeting either by expressing support in person or in a written submission to the meeting. 

The Compact TSC will revoke the administrator rights of a CoIP Editor over the CoIP repository (and they will cease to be a CoIP Editor) if one of the following happens:
- The CoIP Editor themselves asks to resign
- The CoIP Editor fails to attend X CoIP Editor meetings in a row and a petition is sent to the Compact TSC
- All other CoIP Editors vote to remove that specific Editor. 


## Path to Active

Every CoIP must define the criteria it must meet to transition from "Accepted" to "Active".

### Acceptance Criteria

Define objective criteria such as:
- Adoption by core client implementations
- Implementation by community projects
- Community consensus in workshop sessions
- Endorsement by Compact maintainers or validators

### Implementation Plan

Describe how the CoIP will be executed.
This may include:
- Timeline for integration into Compact core software
- Teams responsible for development
- Testing and audit milestones


### CoIP Template

All CoIP documents *must* follow this Markdown template and use YAML front matter:

CoIP: <Number> # assigned by editors

Title: <Proposal Title>

Authors: <Name> <github-username>

Status: <Status> # All new CoIPs will assigned Proposed

Category: <Core | Standards | Networking | Governance | Informational>
