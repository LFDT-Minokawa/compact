# Notation

The syntax of Compact programs is given by an EBNF grammar.  We use the following
notational conventions in the grammar:

- Terminals are in <b><tt>bold monospaced</tt></b> font
- Non-terminals are in <em>emphasized</em> font
- Alternation is indicated by a vertical bar (`|`)
- Repetition of zero or more items is indicated by enclosing them in curly
  braces (`{` and `}`)
- Optional items are indicated by enclosing them in square brackets (`[` and
  `]`)

A Compact program is *well-typed* if it does not contain any type error.  If
a program element such as a type declaration, expression, or statement contains
a type error, then the Compact compiler will not compile that program.
