# Agenda

- [x] Welcome to the first Minokawa team meeting ;)
- [x] Unshielded tokens merge to main: options
      o UT -> Main, Main -> CC, PR to land CC
      o CC -> CC feature branch, UT -> UT feature branch, release from feature branches
      o More generally: how do we manage the release tarpit?
      o Make a 0.27-beta that `compact` doesn't find implicitly, leads to two release
        branches
      o When do we move 0.27-beta UT into main?  What's the threshold?
- [x] We **just** found out that we are making a compactc 0.25.103 (.104) release for
      the node toolkit?
